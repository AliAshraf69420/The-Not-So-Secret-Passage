## Appearance:
	The passage is an area between an apartment building and a “garden” that’s right next to it (the garden is very neglected but it has so much potential). The metal fence in the beginning of the pathway and the garden’s trees is what really makes it beautiful. A group of dogs live in its area, they bark at everyone who goes near the pathway but they're all bark no bite. some of the trees in the garden are tall enough so technically the leaves are a psuedo roof for the pathway (So it looks like a corridor). The fence that's in the pathway's beginning it looks like it's been painted green but the color has faded because of the sun probably.
